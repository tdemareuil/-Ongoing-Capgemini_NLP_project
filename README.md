# Capgemini_NLP_project

This repository holds files related to a consulting misssion conducted in association with Capgemini in February-March 2020. I teamed up with classmates from my MSc Data Science at Ecole Polytechnique to conduct a mock consulting mission for AccorHotels UK, under supervision of Capgemini Invent Consultants from the Paris office.

The project involved NLP to analyse reviews on TripAdvisor and provide strategic recommendations (rebranding, cost/revenue management) to the BÃ´kan Restaurant in Canary Wharf, London.

Techniques to be implemented are:
* data collection (scrapping)
* data cleaning
* word embedding
* topic extraction
* sentiment analysis
* strategic recommendations.
