# Capgemini_NLP_project

This repository will hold files related to a consulting misssion conducted in association with Capgemini in February-March 2020. MSc Data Science students teamed up with Capgemini Invent Consultants from the Paris office to conduct a mock consulting mission for AccorHotels UK.

The project involved NLP to analyse reviews on TripAdvisor and provide strategic recommendations (rebranding, cost/revenue management) to the BÃ´kan Restaurant in Canary Wharf, London.

Techniques to be implemented are:
* data collection (scrapping)
* data cleaning
* word embedding
* topic extraction
* sentiment analysis
* strategic recommendations.
